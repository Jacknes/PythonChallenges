Python Challenge 2 - Longest Word
==

**The Problem:** *Your essay is way over character limit, but way under word limit. You need to write a program that reads in words until you enter a fullstop (.), after which it will determine the longest word. If multiple words match, it should return the first one entered.*

**Example I/O (Input/Output):**

Example 1:

	Word: The
	Word: cat
	Word: in
	Word: the
	Word: house
	Word: .
	Longest Word: house
	
	
Example 2: 

	Word: There
	Word: once
	Word: was
	Word: a
	Word: man
	Word: named
	Word: Tom
	Word: .
	Longest Word: There
	
**Further Explanation:**
Your code should allow the user to keep entering words until they enter a fullstop. As seen above, if the longest word is the same length as another (There and named), your code should return the word entered first (There).
