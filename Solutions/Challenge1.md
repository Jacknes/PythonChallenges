Python Challenge 1 - Largest Rainfall
==

**The Problem:** *The weather channel has a large amount of rainfall data, and they wish to find out which days had the largest amount of rainfall. You must write a simple program to solve this goal. They want to be able to enter as many double values (decimal eg. 4.56) separated by a comma (,). Your program should return the largest double in the list.*

**Example I/O (Input/Output):**

Example 1:

	Please enter the rainfall: 4.34,8.65,2.34,5.64
	Highest Rainfall: 8.65
	
	
Example 2: 

	Please enter the rainfall: 1.23,6.54,2.34,9.83,3.45
	Highest Rainfall: 9.83
	
**Further Explanation:**
Your code should allow the user to enter any number of rainfall amounts separated by a comma and print out the largest double in the list.
